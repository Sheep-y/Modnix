Supporting three mod formats,
Modnix is designed to succeed (replace) [Phoenix Point](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme) [Mod Loader](https://github.com/Ijwu/PhoenixPointModLoader/)s.

It is a lot more feature-packed and thus more complicated than PPML.
If you find bugs, please report on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/issues) or [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/43?tab=bugs).

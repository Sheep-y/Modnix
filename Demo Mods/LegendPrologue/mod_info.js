   Description : "
Enables the Prologue and Tutorial option for Legend difficulty, when starting a new game.  It can still be unticked to skip both.

This mod also serves as a demo for Modnix 3's disarm and rearm feature.
If you have the 'Debug Console' mod, you can use these commands to disarm and rearm this mod in the game:

> modnix mod_disarm Sheepy.LegendPrologue
> modnix mod_rearm Sheepy.LegendPrologue

When this mod is disarmed, it will cease to work.
Note that you need to re-select the Legend difficulty to see the change.
